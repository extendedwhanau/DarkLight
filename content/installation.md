      The perception of an end of one form and a beginning of another. It’s a beautiful illusion created by distance and assembled in our neocortex.As we move closer, the horizon moves too, like the threshold of the speed of light we can never traverse.In reality there is no Other. Molecules flow between perceived forms. Nature, humanity, technology and form are all intimately connected through the ever flowing stream of life that forges connection throughout the cosmos.

      The sounds you hear, all recorded from electromagnetic fields around Okura Bay, represent the molecular fusion of life through this vibrant light horizon stretched out before you.

    name: Cymatic Etherium

      Artists: Peter Hobbs and Catherine Ellis

      Sound Design: Peter Hobbs


      Music is vibration is life. This large-scale work is a part of Peter's ongoing investigations into the relationship between music, light and perception, and vibration as the basis of all life and connection.


      Music resonates with lasers and speakers, focused into a reflective oval pool where light and sound meet the cymatic water surface to create a cinematic wall of ethereal projections dancing to the process of music made physical.\

    name: Flux

      Artist: Trace Element

      Sound Design: Sinclair


      Flux is an interactive installation that transforms its space into a responsive pool of liquid light. Visitors' movements trigger cascading formations of luminous metallic substance. Using optical flow, real-time fluid dynamics and raytracing, the work creates an ever-evolving audiovisual composition that responds to human presence.

      A sensory symphony, composed of fragments, more beautiful for having been broken. A harmonious blend of creative hands, of sight, sound, taste and smell.

    name: Orbit
    content: >-
      Artist: Luke Foley-Martin


      Orbit extends Luke Foley-Martin's exploration of light and its hidden spectrums. Presented as a series of 10 small-scale projected motion-picture videos, the work studies an abstract object, revealing its form only through the shaping effects of coloured light. Filmed at extreme sensitivity, the rotating light becomes both subject and material, its granular noise uncovering colours at the edge of perception.

      The Edge is a place of pause- where sea, city, and sky converge in shifting light, offering a moment of reflection at the horizon.
