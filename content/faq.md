  - question: "Resonate at Darklight"
    answer: |
      Building on the synergy between light and sound, Resonate at Darklight is a one-night-only audiovisual experience like no other. At its heart are six large-scale, fully immersive artworks, each a world of its own, that invite you to step inside and lose yourself in waves of shifting light, sound and motion. As you journey through these transformative installations, the night culminates in a powerful fusion of sensory elements with a boundary-pushing lineup of cutting-edge DJs and live acts.

  - question: "About the venue"
    answer: |
      BRAD's is a two-level historic stone building which we understand was constructed in 1861, making it one of Auckland's most significant heritage buildings. The property is listed as a Category 'A' Building on the Schedule of Historic Heritage Places.
