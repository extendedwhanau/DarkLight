      DarkLight is created by Angus Muir Design, an award-winning studio known
      for immersive installations using light, sound, and materials. Led by
      Angus Muir, with event producer Dan Move, co-founder of LUMA Queenstown,
      the team brings creative visions to life globally.


      Darkness is a stage for light to reveal its complexities. In the dark, light holds the power to liquify, crystallize, dissolve, and reform with its sharp edges, and soft diffusions. This journey is about shifting and unravelling the structure of light to reveal the spectrum of colour within.
