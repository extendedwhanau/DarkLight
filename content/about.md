      DarkLight is created by Angus Muir Design, an award-winning studio known for immersive installations using light, sound, and materials. Led by Angus Muir, with event producer Dan Move, co-founder of LUMA Queenstown, the team brings creative visions to life globally.

      Darkness is a stage for light to reveal its complexities. In the dark, light holds the power to liquify, crystallize, dissolve, and reform with its sharp edges, and soft diffusions. This journey is about shifting and unraveling the structure of light to reveal the spectrum of colour within.

      The first of its kind in New Zealand, Darklight invites attendees to experience the art of light through a series of interactive walk-through audio visual installations. This is a journey exhibition, where you can experience light unfolding into its various forms. Step in. Let darkness guide you. Let light transform you.

      DarkLight unfolds across three stages- The Threshold, A Rift in the Light, and The Unknown

      **The Threshold**

      Step into darkness, where white light hovers in the void, stripped to its purest form. Shifting between states of solid and fluid, it stretches and dissolves into the shadows, inviting you to tune into its structural force.

      **A Rift in the Light**

      Here, transformation begins. White light fractures open, revealing the hidden spectrum within. Deep soundscapes echo as colour starts to bleed into the darkness.

      **The Unknown**

      Descending down the stairs, Light is unleashed in its fullest potential, blossoming from stark white into saturated waves of colour that flood the space. It constructs a fleeting architecture, engulfing you in every direction, building itself into form, only to dissolve back into the dark. Let the light reshape you.

      **About the venue**
